Project Description:
	This is an implementation of a small real-time executive (RTX)
	that will run on a MCF5307-based microcontroller board. The 
	executive provides a basic multiprogramming environment, with 
	5 priority levels, preemption, simple memory management, 
	message-based interprocess communication, a basic timing service, 
	a system console I/O and debugging support.

Description of Archive Contents:
	- *submit* directory - contains all scripts and source and header
	  files needed to compile our group's implementation of RTX P4.
	- *rtx_test_file* directory - contains our group's rtx_test.s19 file

Compilation Procedure:
	- Browse to the *submit* folder.
	- Type "make" (without quotation marks).
	- "make clean" or "make clear" will delete all compiled files for a 
	  "fresh" compilation.
	
Alternate Compilation Procedure (to merge in a test file, assuming a test 
file named rtx_test_ext.s19 exists in the submit directory):
	- Browse to the *submit* folder.
	- Type "make test" (without quotation marks).
	- "make clean" or "make clear" will delete all compiled files for a 
	  "fresh" compilation.

Commands (all case-sensitive):
	- %WS hh:mm:ss will enable the wallclock, where hh is the hours 
	  placeholder, mm is the minutes placeholder, and ss is the seconds
	  placeholder.
	- %WT will stop the wallclock.
	- %clr will clear the screen.
	- %C pid priority will change the priority of any given process.
	- %Z will run the stress tests with their default priorities 
	  (a = 3, b = 2, c = 1).
	
Other Notes:
	The Makefile included with our implementation of RTX P4 creates four
	different .s19 files, listed below:
		- core.s19 (core functionality for the OS)
		- rtx_loader.s19 (OS loader)
		- rtx_test.s19 (contains required six test processes)
		- rtx.s19 (required submission for P4)

	core.s19 and rtx_loader.s19 make up the RTX itself.  rtx.s19 is a
	combination of core.s19, rtx_loader.s19, and rtx_test.s19.

	Hotkeys can be enabled by browsing to submit/shared/dbug.h and
	uncommenting the line containing the following: #define _DEBUG_HOTKEYS.
	
	Valid hotkeys are !, @, #, $, ^, &, and * (the functionality of the
	hotkeys should be obvious by their respective outputs in the debug console).
	
	#define _TEST_DEBUG has been DISABLED in this submission.  If it is needed,
	it can be re-enabled by uncommenting the respective line in
	submit/shared/dbug.h.
